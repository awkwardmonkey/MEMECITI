# MEMECITI: Coming Soon to the MEMEverse!

MEMECITY is an upcoming sensation in the MEMEverse! The development is being carried out using a robust and powerful tech stack to ensure you have an unprecedented experience in the MEMEverse.

## Tech Stack Overview:

- **Quasar**: Our UI is built using Quasar, a high-performance, feature-packed UI component library that offers responsive design and a wealth of pre-built components.
  
- **Vue.js**: The UI comes alive with Vue.js, a modern and versatile JavaScript framework that allows us to create an intuitive and reactive user interface.
  
- **Babylon.JS**: For a top-notch, immersive gaming experience, we're using Babylon.JS. This powerful, feature-packed 3D game engine allows us to create stunning and highly interactive virtual environments.

## Development Tools:

We're using some of the most robust and efficient tools in our development process:

- **Webpack**: For bundling our application and managing dependencies, we use Webpack. It ensures that our application is optimized and ready to run smoothly.
  
- **Babel**: Our code is compiled using Babel, a JavaScript compiler that helps us use the latest language features while ensuring compatibility with different browser environments.
  
- **ESLint**: To maintain high code quality and adherence to best practices, we use ESLint. It helps us catch errors and maintain a consistent code style across the project.
  
- **Jest**: We believe in thorough testing, and for that, we use Jest. It's a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.

**Please note:** We have made significant updates to Memeland. All prior versions designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux are no longer supported. Please transition to the newly improved [MEMECITI Interface](https://github.com/awkwardmonkey/memeciti-interface) for an enhanced web-based experience. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to evolve Memeland for the better.

The MEMECITI Interface relies heavily on the [MEMECITI SDK](https://github.com/awkwardmonkey/memeciti-sdk), which brings you the networking, metaverse, and scripting functionalities that you'll love.

We can't wait to welcome you to MEMECITI - Coming soon to the MEMEverse!
